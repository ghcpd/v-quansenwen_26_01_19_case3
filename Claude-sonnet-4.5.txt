User: ### Role

You are a **senior front-end engineer** specializing in React + TypeScript and modern UI engineering.

---

### Task

Create a **complete front-end project from scratch** for a **Music Playlist Builder** web app (MVP).
The app lets users browse a mock music library, create playlists, add/remove tracks, reorder tracks, and play previews (simulated).

This task evaluates your ability to build a clean, runnable, well-structured front-end project from **0 to 1**.

---

## 1) Product Requirements

### Core Concept

Users can:

* Browse a **music library** (mock data)
* Create and manage **multiple playlists**
* Add tracks to playlists
* Reorder tracks inside a playlist
* “Play” a track preview (UI simulation only — no real audio required)

### Pages (Required)

1. **Library Page**

   * Track list with search + filters
   * “Add to playlist” action per track
2. **Playlists Page**

   * List of playlists
   * Create / rename / delete playlist
3. **Playlist Detail Page**

   * Track list in the playlist
   * Reorder tracks (drag-and-drop OR up/down buttons)
   * Remove track
   * Play preview (simulated player UI)
4. **Now Playing Drawer/Bar (Global UI)**

   * Shows current track, play/pause state, progress bar (mock)

---

## 2) Functional Requirements

### Music Library

* Provide at least **40 mock tracks** with fields:

  * id, title, artist, album, durationSec, coverImageUrl, genre, year
* Must support:

  * Search by title/artist
  * Filter by genre
  * Sort by: newest, duration, title (A–Z)

### Playlists

* Users can:

  * Create playlist (name required, validation)
  * Rename playlist
  * Delete playlist (confirm dialog)
  * Add track to a playlist (prevent duplicate tracks in a playlist)
  * Remove track from playlist
  * Reorder tracks in playlist
* Display:

  * Track count
  * Total duration (sum of durationSec)

### Player (Simulated)

* Play/pause toggles state
* Progress bar advances using a timer (e.g., setInterval) while “playing”
* Next/Previous track within the **current playlist**
* If a playlist is deleted while playing, handle gracefully (stop playback)

---

## 3) UI / UX Requirements

* Modern, clean, music-app aesthetic
* Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
* Clear empty states:

  * No playlists yet
  * Playlist has no tracks
  * Search yields no results
* Toast or inline feedback for key actions:

  * “Added to playlist”
  * “Already in playlist”
  * “Playlist created”
* Basic accessibility:

  * Buttons have labels
  * Keyboard focus styles are visible

---

## 4) Technical Requirements

### Stack

* React + TypeScript
* Build tool: **Vite** (preferred)
* Routing: React Router
* State management: React hooks + Context (no Redux)
* Styling: choose ONE and be consistent:

  * Tailwind CSS OR CSS Modules OR styled-components

### Data

* No backend.
* Use mock data locally.
* Persist playlists and “now playing” state to **localStorage**.

### Engineering Discipline

* Must use a clean folder structure like:

```
src/
  components/
  pages/
  context/
  hooks/
  data/
  utils/
  types/
  styles/
  App.tsx
  main.tsx
```

* Use TypeScript interfaces/types for core entities
* No dead code, no TODO placeholders

---

## 5) Deliverables (Must Output All)

1. **Project Overview**

   * What the app does
   * MVP scope and non-goals
2. **Feature List**

   * Core + nice-to-have future features
3. **Page-by-page Breakdown**
4. **Component Breakdown**

   * Key components and responsibilities
5. **Folder Structure**
6. **Implementation**

   * Provide the **actual code** for the project:

     * `package.json` (scripts included)
     * `vite` setup notes
     * all required `src/` files
7. **Run Instructions**

   * Clear steps to install and start
8. **Quick Manual Test Checklist**

   * Steps to verify key flows

---

## 6) Constraints

* Do NOT use a real audio API or external streaming service
* Do NOT call real network endpoints
* Do NOT reference or clone any existing music product branding
* Must be runnable locally with minimal steps
